 Take 1 teaspoon instant yeast (3 grams) and add ½ teaspoon sugar in a mixing bowl or in the stand mixer bowl. If using dry active yeast or fresh yeast
Then add 1 cup water. Mix well.
 Next add 3 cups whole wheat flour and 1 teaspoon salt.
Add 3 tablespoons olive oil. If you do not have olive oil, use any neutral flavoured oil
 Attach the bowl to a stand mixer with the hook attachment. On a medium-high speed knead the dough. If kneading with hands, then mix everything very well and then knead for at least 8 to 10 minutes.
The dough should be smooth, pliable and soft. If the dough looks dry, then you can add some water while kneading. If the dough looks sticky, then you can sprinkle some flour. Depending on the quality of flour, you will need to add less or more water.
spread some water all over the dough.
 Cover with a lid or a kitchen towel and allow to leaven till the dough increases in volume and doubles up. I kept for 1 hour 45 minutes as its cold here. That too I kept the bowl in the sun, which is not very strong in the winters. In a warm temperature, you can easily keep for 45 minutes to 1 hour. If using dry active yeast, then keep for 2 hours to 3 hours (depends on the temperature conditions in your city).
The pizza dough will nicely increase in volume and double up.
Knead the dough lightly again and then you can directly make pizzas from these. Or you can keep them covered in a tight box or pan. Spread some olive oil all over the dough before placing them in the box.
Grease a 9 inch pan or tray with some extra virgin olive oil. Sprinkle some flour all over. You can even use cornmeal or semolina for sprinkling. Preheat oven to its maximum temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before baking. my oven has 250 degrees celsius as the highest temperature.
Take a medium to large ball and sprinkle some flour on the dough.
Roll to a thin pizza having 0.3 to 0.5 cm thickness.
Spread pizza sauce or passata.
Add some grated vegetarian parmesan cheese. If you do not have parmesan cheese, then skip this step
Now top with mozzarella cheese or pizza cheese.
Keep the pizza pan on the lower rack near the bottom heating element in the preheated oven. This helps the margherita pizza to get a nice crisp and crusty base. Only use the bottom heating element in the oven. Also, keep your oven’s highest temperature. My oven has 250 degrees celsius as the highest. You can also keep the pizza pan in the centre rack.
Bake the pizza for 10 to 15 minutes till the base gets golden and the cheese also melts and gets golden.
Top the pizza with some torn fresh basil leaves. You can also add dried oregano or red chili flakes if you want. You can also drizzle some extra virgin olive on the margherita pizza before serving
Cut with a pizza cutter or knife and Serve margherita pizza.
